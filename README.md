# Less Flashing Lights:

This mod attempts to reduce the amount of flashing lights in the game. More specifically, it targets animations such as:
 
- Healing
- Sitting on a bench
- CDashing
- Using nail arts
- Spells usage and spell collection animations
- Absolute Radiance and Radiance's death, orb impact, teleportation
- Uumuu getting struck by Quirrel
- Jellyfish explosions
- Warrior dreams apparition and death
- Most enemies hit effects, including normal hits and hits from grimmchild, defender's crest and sporeshroom
- The knight's flickering animation when taking damage/respawning/collecting lifeblood/getting the shade back
- The subtle flash when getting enough soul to use a spell
- Soul Master and Tyrant fake death, teleportation and dive
- Soul twisters and soul warriors teleportation
- Grimmkin teleportation and Nightmare lantern activation
- Boss screams and deaths
- Pantheon results scene
- Hall of Gods statues state switch (upon victory, spawn and dream lever activation)
- Hornet 2 wind
- Birthplace cutscene
- Whispering roots

You can configure which of these effects to remove through the mod's menu. Due to the way the game reuses effects, some options may interact with each other. For instance, "Remove white hit flashes", which includes most enemies that flash white when hit, will also affect the healing flash. Similarly, part of nail arts flashes come Crystal Dash effects. Additionally, some settings require a save reload to be applied properly if changed while the game is paused.

# What this mod doesn't do, but can be achieved with other mods:
- Remove particles (can be achieved with No Particles)
- Darken transitions (can be achieved with DarkerTransitions)
- Disable screen shake (can be achieved with DebugMod or by editing the value of CameraShakeMultiplier to 0 in the file named Config.ini in the game's files)

# Note: 
As I am not photosensitive myself, it is almost guaranteed that I missed some flashing lights. Therefore, do not hesitate to contact me so that I can update the mod to include them (@wangha on Discord).
