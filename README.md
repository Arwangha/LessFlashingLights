# Less Flashing Lights:

This mod attempts to reduce the amount of flashing lights in the game. More specifically, it targets animations such as:
 
- Healing
- Sitting on a bench
- CDashing
- Spells usage
- Absolute Radiance and Radiance's death
- Absolute Radiance and Radiance's orb impact
- Absolute Radiance and Radiance's teleportation
- Uumuu getting struck by Quirrel
- Warrior dreams apparition
- Warrior dreams death
- Soul Master's fake death
- Soul Master's teleportation is slightly attenuated too
- Pantheon results scene
- Hornet 2 wind

# What this mod doesn't do, but can be achieved with other mods:
- Remove particles
- Darken transitions
- Disable screen shake

# Note: 
As I am not photosensitive myself, it is almost guaranteed that I missed some flashing lights. Therefore, do not hesitate to contact me so that I can update the mod to include them.
